# cr0pper
Qt based image cropper

This was built using Qt 5.10 but should work with anything 5.0 and higher.

The goal of this software it to do fast manual cropping of a lot of images. 
Rather than rubber banding around the image to select a crop area you just click 
on the left, top, right and bottom of the area you want to crop.
